          I have high skills in Development, SoftWare Testing and IT
          infrastructure.

        <p>
          I’m a passionate and results-driven web developer and software tester
          with 3 years of combined experience in front-end development, UI/UX
          design, and cybersecurity. My commitment to creating secure,
          user-friendly, and scalable systems has driven successful projects
          across both corporate and academic environments. I thrive in
          collaborative settings and enjoy every stage of the development
          lifecycle—from requirements gathering to final deployment. Whether
          transforming Figma designs into responsive web interfaces or ensuring
          seamless API integration, I bring precision, creativity, and
          dedication to every project I work on.
